### Glacier Programming Language

**Version:** 0.1-alpha  
**Status:** Emotionally unstable  
**Author:** Just me. I don't even speak Kalaallisut.  

---

### Introduction

**Glacier** is a high-level, low-compassion programming language written entirely in **Kalaallisut**, structured with the chaotic elegance of **C++**, **Python**, and pure hatred. Code blocks are defined using **`$`** instead of braces because curly brackets are for cowards.

Glacier is designed to confuse readers, scare recruiters, and spiritually injure anyone who dares `git clone`.

---

### Features

- Entire syntax in **Kalaallisut** (even though I don't know it).
- Uses `$` to denote code blocks.
- Inspired by **C++**, **C#**, and **Python**, then corrupted.
- Readable only to the extremely devoted or linguistically unhinged.
- Supports basic math, conditionals, loops, and existential dread.

### File Extension

Glacier source files use `.glacier` â€” which does absolutely nothing except cause GitHub to render them as plain text.

### Example Program

najoqqutaq_main() $
    nanoq a = 10;
    nanoq b = 20;
    nalunaarpoq aaqqinneq(nanoq x, nanoq y) $
        allappoq("Akia: " + (x + y));
    $
    aaqqinneq(a, b);
$

### Language Syntax

Data Types
Kalaallisut	Type (English)
nanoq	int
sermeq	float
sila	string
anori	bool
siku	array

### Functions
Use nalunaarpoq to declare a function.

nalunaarpoq isumaliutissiissut(nanoq x, nanoq y) $
    allappoq(x + y);
$

### Conditionals

imaaluunniit (a > b) $
    allappoq("a angineruvoq");
imaluunniit (a == b) $
    allappoq("naliginnaapput");
allanit $
    allappoq("a minneruvoq");
$
