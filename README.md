# Glacier-Calculator
Glacier isn't a real programming language, but I'm working on it!

### What is Glacier?
Glacier is a programming language made by me (Terminl Sochi)!
It is a mix of C/C++/C# and Python, and written in Greenlandic/Kalaallisut!
This serves no purpose, it's just something I came up with and I love it.

### Is there an official interpreter or compiler?
No, not yet but I will begin on it at some point.
Glacier will be a compiled language when it's done, but first I will work on an interpreter written in Python.

### Does the code in this repository actually work?
Nope!
