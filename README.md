# Glacier-Calculator
Glacier isn't a real programming language, but I'm working on it!

### What is Glacier?
Glacier is a programming language made by me (Terminl Sochi)!
It is Python based, and written in Greenlandic/Kalaallisut!
This serves no purpose, it's just something I came up with and I love it.
