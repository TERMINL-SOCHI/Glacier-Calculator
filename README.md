### SikuLang
This repo is for examples of programs, written in Siku. A programming language being developed by Terminl (me)

### What is Siku?
Siku is a programming language made by me (Terminl)!
It is a mix of C/C++/C# and Python, and written in Greenlandic/Kalaallisut!
This serves no purpose, it's just something I came up with and I love it.

### Is there an official interpreter or compiler?
No, not yet but I will begin on it at some point.
Siku will be a compiled language when it's done, but first I will work on an interpreter written in Python.

### Does the code in this repository actually work?
Nope!

### About the compiler
So in total, Project Siku is going to include the language, the compiler, and an Integrated Development Environment.
Coming 2027
