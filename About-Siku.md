### SikuLang Scripting language

**Version:** 0.1-alpha  
**Status:** i want to kms
**Author:** Just me. I don't even speak Kalaallisut.  
**Why:** I don't know, i just hate myself

<hr>

### Introduction

**Siku** is a high-level,  programming language written entirely in **Kalaallisut**, structured with the chaos of **C++**, **Python**, and pure self-hate. Code blocks are defined using **`$`** instead of braces because curly brackets are for cowards.

Siku is designed to confuse readers, scare recruiters, and emotionally ruin anyone who dares `git clone`.
Siku has no official interpreter or compiler yet, but I am working on it. It will take a while but one day the official Siku compiler shall release.

### Siku Compiler

The compielr I will build for Siku will work by translating Siku into Python, and then it will be run. Similar to TypeScript and JavaScript.

### Features

- Entire syntax in **Kalaallisut** (even though I don't know it).
- Uses `$` to denote code blocks instead of `{ }`.
- Inspired by **C++**, **C**, and **Python**, then turned into a torture method.
- Readable only to someone with godlike memory, or a person who has learnt Kalaallisut (or native Greenlandic people)
- Supports basic math, conditionals, loops, and pain.

### File Extension

Siku source files use `.siku` — `.siku` is not a real file extension, and VS Code (and GitHub) just treat them as text files

### Example Program

najoqqutaq_main() $
    nanoq a = 10;
    nanoq b = 20;
    nalunaarpoq aaqqinneq(nanoq x, nanoq y) $
        allappoq("Akia: " + (x + y));
    $
    aaqqinneq(a, b);
$

### Language Syntax

Data Types
Kalaallisut	Type (English)
nanoq	int
sermeq	float
sila	string
anori	bool
siku	array

### Functions
Use nalunaarpoq to declare a function.

nalunaarpoq isumaliutissiissut(nanoq x, nanoq y) $
    allappoq(x + y);
$

### Conditionals

imaaluunniit (a > b) $
    allappoq("a angineruvoq");
imaluunniit (a == b) $
    allappoq("naliginnaapput");
allanit $
    allappoq("a minneruvoq");
$

### Loops

qaangerniarpoq (nanoq i = 0; i < 5; i++) $
    allappoq(i);
$

### Input and Output

Print: allappoq("...")
Input: atorneq()

### Comments
<br>
`# This is a comment`
`# You are already confused`
